# RAG From Scratch

This repository implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system
from first principles without relying on high-level orchestration frameworks.

## Key Features
- Explicit document ingestion and chunking
- Dense vector retrieval using FAISS
- Modular retriever and reranker design
- Faithfulness and retrieval evaluation
- FastAPI deployment

## Why This Project
Most RAG tutorials hide complexity behind abstractions.
This project focuses on retrieval quality, faithfulness, and evaluation,
demonstrating a deep understanding of RAG systems.

## Future Extensions
- Hybrid BM25 + Dense retrieval
- Cross-encoder reranking
- RAGAS evaluation
- Query rewriting
